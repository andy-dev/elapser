## Acknowledgements

I created this gem as an educational exercise to learn the process and inner workings for creating a gem. I also believe it could be useful to other fellow rubyst. I want to thank instructor Sherif Abushadi and peer Richard Santin who contributed and without them this project would have not existed.
